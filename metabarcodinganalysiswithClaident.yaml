  abstract: >-
    We propose an integrated sampling, rarefaction, and extrapolation
    methodology to compare species richness of a set of communities based on
    samples of equal completeness (as measured by sample coverage) instead of
    equal size. Traditional rarefaction or extrapolation to equal-sized samples
    can misrepresent the relationships between the richnesses of the communities
    being compared because a sample of a given size may be sufficient to fully
    characterize the lower diversity community, but insufficient to characterize
    the richer community. Thus, the traditional method systematically biases the
    degree of differences between community richnesses. We derived a new
    analytic method for seamless coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation.
    We show that this method yields less biased comparisons of richness between
    communities, and manages this with less total sampling effort. When this
    approach is integrated with an adaptive coverage-based stopping rule during
    sampling, samples may be compared directly without rarefaction, so no extra
    data is taken and none is thrown away. Even if this stopping rule is not
    used during data collection, coverage-based rarefaction throws away less
    data than traditional size-based rarefaction, and more efficiently finds the
    correct ranking of communities according to their true richnesses. Several
    hypothetical and real examples demonstrate these advantages.

  abstract: >-
    Quantifying and assessing changes in biological diversity are central
    aspects of many ecological studies, yet accurate methods of estimating
    biological diversity from sampling data have been elusive. Hill numbers, or
    the effective number of species, are increasingly used to characterize the
    taxonomic, phylogenetic, or functional diversity of an assemblage. However,
    empirical estimates of Hill numbers, including species richness, tend to be
    an increasing function of sampling effort and, thus, tend to increase with
    sample completeness. Integrated curves based on sampling theory that
    smoothly link rarefaction (interpolation) and prediction (extrapolation)
    standardize samples on the basis of sample size or sample completeness and
    facilitate the comparison of biodiversity data. Here we extended previous
    rarefaction and extrapolation models for species richness (Hill number qD,
    where q = 0) to measures of taxon diversity incorporating relative abundance
    (i.e., for any Hill number qD, q > 0) and present a unified approach for
    both individual-based (abundance) data and sample-based (incidence) data.
    Using this unified sampling framework, we derive both theoretical formulas
    and analytic estimators for seamless rarefaction and extrapolation based on
    Hill numbers. Detailed examples are provided for the first three Hill
    numbers: q = 0 (species richness), q = 1 (the exponential of Shannon's
    entropy index), and q = 2 (the inverse of Simpson's concentration index). We
    developed a bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals around
    Hill numbers, facilitating the comparison of multiple assemblages of both
    rarefied and extrapolated samples. The proposed estimators are accurate for
    both rarefaction and short-range extrapolation. For long-range
    extrapolation, the performance of the estimators depends on both the value
    of q and on the extrapolation range. We tested our methods on simulated data
    generated from species abundance models and on data from large species
    inventories. We also illustrate the formulas and estimators using empirical
    data sets from biodiversity surveys of temperate forest spiders and tropical
    ants.

  abstract: >-
    Based on sampling data, we propose a rigorous standardization method to
    measure and compare beta diversity across datasets. Here beta diversity,
    which quantifies the extent of among-assemblage differentiation, relies on
    Whittaker's original multiplicative decomposition scheme, but we use Hill
    numbers for any diversity order q ≥ 0. Richness-based beta diversity (q = 0)
    quantifies the extent of species identity shift, whereas abundance-based (q
    > 0) beta diversity also quantifies the extent of difference among
    assemblages in species abundance. We adopt and define the assumptions of a
    statistical sampling model as the foundation for our approach, treating
    sampling data as a representative sample taken from an assemblage. The
    approach makes a clear distinction between the theoretical assemblage level
    (unknown properties/parameters of the assemblage) and the sampling data
    level (empirical/observed statistics computed from data). At the assemblage
    level, beta diversity for N assemblages reflects the interacting effect of
    the species abundance distribution and spatial/temporal aggregation of
    individuals in the assemblage. Under independent sampling, observed beta (=
    gamma/alpha) diversity depends not only on among-assemblage differentiation
    but also on sampling effort/completeness, which in turn induces dependence
    of beta on alpha and gamma diversity. How to remove the dependence of
    richness-based beta diversity on its gamma component (species pool) has been
    intensely debated. Our approach is to standardize gamma and alpha based on
    sample coverage (an objective measure of sample completeness). For a single
    assemblage, the iNEXT method was developed, through interpolation
    (rarefaction) and extrapolation with Hill numbers, to standardize samples by
    sampling effort/completeness. Here we adapt the iNEXT standardization to
    alpha and gamma diversity, that is, alpha and gamma diversity are both
    assessed at the same level of sample coverage, to formulate standardized,
    coverage-based beta diversity. This extension of iNEXT to beta diversity
    required the development of novel concepts and theories, including a formal
    proof and simulation-based demonstration that the resulting standardized
    beta diversity removes the dependence of beta diversity on both gamma and
    alpha values, and thus reflects the pure among-assemblage differentiation.
    The proposed standardization is illustrated with spatial, temporal, and
    spatiotemporal datasets, while the freeware iNEXT.beta3D facilitates all
    computations and graphics.

  abstract: >-
    Estimating and comparing microbial diversity are statistically challenging
    due to limited sampling and possible sequencing errors for low-frequency
    counts, producing spurious singletons. The inflated singleton count
    seriously affects statistical analysis and inferences about microbial
    diversity. Previous statistical approaches to tackle the sequencing errors
    generally require different parametric assumptions about the sampling model
    or about the functional form of frequency counts. Different parametric
    assumptions may lead to drastically different diversity estimates. We focus
    on nonparametric methods which are universally valid for all parametric
    assumptions and can be used to compare diversity across communities. We
    develop here a nonparametric estimator of the true singleton count to
    replace the spurious singleton count in all methods/approaches. Our
    estimator of the true singleton count is in terms of the frequency counts of
    doubletons, tripletons and quadrupletons, provided these three frequency
    counts are reliable. To quantify microbial alpha diversity for an individual
    community, we adopt the measure of Hill numbers (effective number of taxa)
    under a nonparametric framework. Hill numbers, parameterized by an order q
    that determines the measures’ emphasis on rare or common species, include
    taxa richness (q = 0), Shannon diversity (q = 1, the exponential of Shannon
    entropy), and Simpson diversity (q = 2, the inverse of Simpson index). A
    diversity profile which depicts the Hill number as a function of order q
    conveys all information contained in a taxa abundance distribution. Based on
    the estimated singleton count and the original non-singleton frequency
    counts, two statistical approaches (non-asymptotic and asymptotic) are
    developed to compare microbial diversity for multiple communities. (1) A
    non-asymptotic approach refers to the comparison of estimated diversities of
    standardized samples with a common finite sample size or sample
    completeness. This approach aims to compare diversity estimates for
    equally-large or equally-complete samples; it is based on the seamless
    rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curves of Hill numbers, specifically
    for q = 0, 1 and 2. (2) An asymptotic approach refers to the comparison of
    the estimated asymptotic diversity profiles. That is, this approach compares
    the estimated profiles for complete samples or samples whose size tends to
    be sufficiently large. It is based on statistical estimation of the true
    Hill number of any order q ≥ 0. In the two approaches, replacing the
    spurious singleton count by our estimated count, we can greatly remove the
    positive biases associated with diversity estimates due to spurious
    singletons and also make fair comparisons across microbial communities, as
    illustrated in our simulation results and in applying our method to analyze
    sequencing data from viral metagenomes.

  abstract: "Motivation: Chimeric DNA sequences often form during polymerase chain reaction amplification, especially when sequencing single regions (e.g. 16S rRNA or fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer) to assess diversity or compare populations. Undetected chimeras may be misinterpreted as novel species, causing inflated estimates of diversity and spurious inferences of differences between populations. Detection and removal of chimeras is therefore of critical importance in such experiments.Results: We describe UCHIME, a new program that detects chimeric sequences with two or more segments. UCHIME either uses a database of chimera-free sequences or detects chimeras de novo by exploiting abundance data. UCHIME has better sensitivity than ChimeraSlayer (previously the most sensitive database method), especially with short, noisy sequences. In testing on artificial bacterial communities with known composition, UCHIME de novo sensitivity is shown to be comparable to Perseus. UCHIME is &gt;100× faster than Perseus and &gt;1000× faster than ChimeraSlayer.Contact: \_robert@drive5.comAvailability: Source, binaries and data: http://drive5.com/uchime.Supplementary information: \_Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."

    Tagging amplicons with tag sequences appended to PCR primers allow the
    multiplexing of numerous samples for high-throughput sequencing (HTS). This
    approach is routinely used in HTS-based diversity analyses, especially in
    microbial ecology and biomedical diagnostics. However, amplicon library
    preparation is subject to pervasive sample sequence cross-contaminations as
    a result of tag switching events referred to as mistagging. Here, we
    sequenced seven amplicon libraries prepared using various multiplexing
    designs in order to measure the magnitude of this phenomenon and its impact
    on diversity analyses. Up to 28.2% of the unique sequences correspond to
    undetectable (critical) mistags in single- or saturated double-tagging
    libraries. We show the advantage of multiplexing samples following Latin
    Square Designs in order to optimize the detection of mistags and maximize
    the information on their distribution across samples. We use this
    information in designs incorporating PCR replicates to filter the critical
    mistags and to recover the exact composition of mock community samples.
    Being parameter-free and data-driven, our approach can provide more accurate
    and reproducible HTS data sets, improving the reliability of their
    interpretations.

  abstract: >-
    Hill numbers (or the effective number of species) have been increasingly
    used to quantify the species/taxonomic diversity of an assemblage. The
    sample-size- and coverage-based integrations of rarefaction (interpolation)
    and extrapolation (prediction) of Hill numbers represent a unified
    standardization method for quantifying and comparing species diversity
    across multiple assemblages. We briefly review the conceptual background of
    Hill numbers along with two approaches to standardization. We present an R
    package iNEXT (iNterpolation/EXTrapolation) which provides simple functions
    to compute and plot the seamless rarefaction and extrapolation sampling
    curves for the three most widely used members of the Hill number family
    (species richness, Shannon diversity and Simpson diversity). Two types of
    biodiversity data are allowed: individual-based abundance data and
    sampling-unit-based incidence data. Several applications of the iNEXT
    packages are reviewed: (i) Non-asymptotic analysis: comparison of diversity
    estimates for equally large or equally complete samples. (ii) Asymptotic
    analysis: comparison of estimated asymptotic or true diversities. (iii)
    Assessment of sample completeness (sample coverage) across multiple samples.
    (iv) Comparison of estimated point diversities for a specified sample size
    or a specified level of sample coverage. Two examples are demonstrated,
    using the data (one for abundance data and the other for incidence data)
    included in the package, to illustrate all R functions and graphical
    displays.

  abstract: >-
    Model-based methods have emerged as a powerful approach for analysing
    multivariate abundance data in community ecology. Key applications include
    model-based ordination, modelling the various sources of correlations across
    species, and making inferences while accounting for these between species
    correlations. boral (version 0.9.1, licence GPL-2) is an r package available
    on cran for model-based analysis of multivariate abundance data, with
    estimation performed using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. A key
    feature of the boral package is the ability to incorporate latent variables
    as a parsimonious method of modelling between species correlation. Pure
    latent variable models offer a model-based approach to unconstrained
    ordination, for visualizing sites and the indicator species characterizing
    them on a low-dimensional plot. Correlated response models consist of
    fitting generalized linear models to each species, while including latent
    variables to account for residual correlation between species, for example,
    due to unmeasured covariates.

  abstract: >-
    Metagenomics is the study of the genomic content of a sample of organisms
    obtained from a common habitat using targeted or random sequencing. Goals
    include understanding the extent and role of microbial diversity. The
    taxonomical content of such a sample is usually estimated by comparison
    against sequence databases of known sequences. Most published studies use
    the analysis of paired-end reads, complete sequences of environmental fosmid
    and BAC clones, or environmental assemblies. Emerging
    sequencing-by-synthesis technologies with very high throughput are paving
    the way to low-cost random “shotgun” approaches. This paper introduces
    MEGAN, a new computer program that allows laptop analysis of large
    metagenomic data sets. In a preprocessing step, the set of DNA sequences is
    compared against databases of known sequences using BLAST or another
    comparison tool. MEGAN is then used to compute and explore the taxonomical
    content of the data set, employing the NCBI taxonomy to summarize and order
    the results. A simple lowest common ancestor algorithm assigns reads to taxa
    such that the taxonomical level of the assigned taxon reflects the level of
    conservation of the sequence. The software allows large data sets to be
    dissected without the need for assembly or the targeting of specific
    phylogenetic markers. It provides graphical and statistical output for
    comparing different data sets. The approach is applied to several data sets,
    including the Sargasso Sea data set, a recently published metagenomic data
    set sampled from a mammoth bone, and several complete microbial genomes.
    Also, simulations that evaluate the performance of the approach for
    different read lengths are presented.

  abstract: >-
    Community ecology beginners often struggle to understand theories expressed
    in complex mathematical formulas and to master computer programming. To
    remedy this situation, this article provides a practical, R-based
    introduction to community ecology by illustrating core concepts (vital
    rates, carrying capacity, and density dependence) and models that can be
    used to explore the patterns of species abundance and diversity. The
    structure of this article consists of three modeling exercises, each asking
    a general question that can be answered by a combination of theory and R
    programming: (1) what determines the abundance of species, and what makes a
    population persist and go extinct?; (2) what determines the distribution of
    species and species diversity?; (3) what determines the relative abundance
    of species and what allows species to coexist? Through the exercises, I
    discuss the following five concepts and ideas that provide valuable insights
    into the questions: (i) the tragedy of the commons, (ii) the theory of
    island biogeography, (iii) competitive exclusion, (iv) the neutral theory of
    biodiversity, and (v) frequency dependence. These materials are thus
    designed to guide the reader in developing an intuition for ecological
    thinking that will help capture the essence of the global environmental and
    biodiversity crisis. Although this article does not delineate the scope and
    depth of the vast field of community ecology, I hope that it will motivate
    the reader to step up to a more formal introduction to community ecology.

    The Decapoda is one of the largest orders within the class Malacostraca,
    comprising approximately 14,000 extant species and including many
    commercially important species. For biodiversity monitoring in a
    non-invasive manner, a new set of PCR primers was developed for
    metabarcoding environmental DNA (eDNA) from decapod crustaceans. The new
    primers (herein named “MiDeca”) were designed for two conservative regions
    of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene, which amplify a short, hyper-variable
    region (153–184 bp, 164 bp on average) with sufficient interspecific
    variations. With the use of MiDeca primers and tissue-derived DNA extracts,
    we successfully determined those sequences (154–189 bp) from 250 species,
    placed in 186 genera and 65 families across the suborder Dendrobranchiata
    and 10 of the 11 infraorders of the suborder Pleocyemata. We also
    preliminarily attempted eDNA metabarcoding from natural seawater collected
    at Banda, Tateyama, the Pacific coast of central Japan and detected 42
    decapod species including 34 and 8 species with sequence identities of &gt;
    98% and 80–98%, respectively. The results suggest the usefulness of eDNA
    metabarcoding with MiDeca primers for biodiversity monitoring of the decapod
    species. It appears, however, that further optimisation of primer sequences
    would still be necessary to avoid possible PCR dropouts from eDNA extracts.

  abstract: >-
    16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and other environmental sequencing techniques
    provide snapshots of microbial communities, revealing phylogeny and the
    abundances of microbial populations across diverse ecosystems. While changes
    in microbial community structure are demonstrably associated with certain
    environmental conditions (from metabolic and immunological health in mammals
    to ecological stability in soils and oceans), identification of underlying
    mechanisms requires new statistical tools, as these datasets present several
    technical challenges. First, the abundances of microbial operational
    taxonomic units (OTUs) from amplicon-based datasets are compositional.
    Counts are normalized to the total number of counts in the sample. Thus,
    microbial abundances are not independent, and traditional statistical
    metrics (e.g., correlation) for the detection of OTU-OTU relationships can
    lead to spurious results. Secondly, microbial sequencing-based studies
    typically measure hundreds of OTUs on only tens to hundreds of samples;
    thus, inference of OTU-OTU association networks is severely under-powered,
    and additional information (or assumptions) are required for accurate
    inference. Here, we present SPIEC-EASI (SParse InversE Covariance Estimation
    for Ecological Association Inference), a statistical method for the
    inference of microbial ecological networks from amplicon sequencing datasets
    that addresses both of these issues. SPIEC-EASI combines data
    transformations developed for compositional data analysis with a graphical
    model inference framework that assumes the underlying ecological association
    network is sparse. To reconstruct the network, SPIEC-EASI relies on
    algorithms for sparse neighborhood and inverse covariance selection. To
    provide a synthetic benchmark in the absence of an experimentally validated
    gold-standard network, SPIEC-EASI is accompanied by a set of computational
    tools to generate OTU count data from a set of diverse underlying network
    topologies. SPIEC-EASI outperforms state-of-the-art methods to recover edges
    and network properties on synthetic data under a variety of scenarios.
    SPIEC-EASI also reproducibly predicts previously unknown microbial
    associations using data from the American Gut project.

    Environmental DNA (eDNA)-based assessments of macro-organisms have now
    become an essential approach for biomonitoring. eDNA survey methods have a
    number of advantages over conventional survey methods. However, the value of
    the data that will accumulate would be greatly enhanced by standardizing the
    analysis methods, which would allow us to compare data from multiple
    monitoring sites at different points in time. The eDNA Society
    (http://ednasociety.org/en/about), whose founding members consist of
    Japanese researchers conducting eDNA studies on macro-organisms, was
    established in 2018, with the aim of expanding eDNA technology and science.
    Here, we introduce our key publication, “Environmental DNA Sampling and
    Experiment Manual” (http://ednasociety.org/en/manual), which was published
    under the initiative of the eDNA Society. Detailed methods for the surveys
    and experiments are described in the manual, including the selection of
    sampling sites, sampling methods, filtration methods, DNA extraction,
    species-specific detection by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and fish
    eDNA metabarcoding. The manual assists users in conducting standardized
    surveys and quality experiments, and provides a basis for collecting
    comparable data. Given that the efficacy of methods can be context dependent
    and variable, and that procedures may sometimes conflict with
    standardization, it is difficult to ensure that all processes are equally
    effective. However, even in such cases, it is important to maintain
    sufficiently high data quality by setting the minimum standards to be
    followed. Implementation of such standardized methodologies will enable the
    systematic and frequent collection of flawless, comparable eDNA data from
    around the world; this will provide important fundamental information for
    biodiversity conservation, as well as the sustainable use of fisheries
    resources.

    We developed a set of universal PCR primers (MiFish-U/E) for metabarcoding
    environmental DNA (eDNA) from fishes. Primers were designed using aligned
    whole mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequences from 880 species,
    supplemented by partial mitogenome sequences from 160 elasmobranchs (sharks
    and rays). The primers target a hypervariable region of the 12S rRNA gene
    (163–185 bp), which contains sufficient information to identify fishes to
    taxonomic family, genus and species except for some closely related
    congeners. To test versatility of the primers across a diverse range of
    fishes, we sampled eDNA from four tanks in the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium
    with known species compositions, prepared dual-indexed libraries and
    performed paired-end sequencing of the region using high-throughput
    next-generation sequencing technologies. Out of the 180 marine fish species
    contained in the four tanks with reference sequences in a custom database,
    we detected 168 species (93.3%) distributed across 59 families and 123
    genera. These fishes are not only taxonomically diverse, ranging from sharks
    and rays to higher teleosts, but are also greatly varied in their ecology,
    including both pelagic and benthic species living in shallow coastal to deep
    waters. We also sampled natural seawaters around coral reefs near the
    aquarium and detected 93 fish species using this approach. Of the 93
    species, 64 were not detected in the four aquarium tanks, rendering the
    total number of species detected to 232 (from 70 families and 152 genera).
    The metabarcoding approach presented here is non-invasive, more efficient,
    more cost-effective and more sensitive than the traditional survey methods.
    It has the potential to serve as an alternative (or complementary) tool for
    biodiversity monitoring that revolutionizes natural resource management and
    ecological studies of fish communities on larger spatial and temporal
    scales.

  abstract: "We reviewed the current methodology and practices of the DNA metabarcoding approach using a universal PCR primer pair MiFish, which co-amplifies a short fragment of fish DNA (approx. 170\_bp from the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene) across a wide variety of taxa. This method has mostly been applied to biodiversity monitoring using environmental DNA (eDNA) shed from fish and, coupled with next-generation sequencing technologies, has enabled massively parallel sequencing of several hundred eDNA samples simultaneously. Since the publication of its technical outline in 2015, this method has been widely used in various aquatic environments in and around the six continents, and MiFish primers have demonstrably outperformed other competing primers. Here, we outline the technical progress in this method over the last 5\_years and highlight some case studies on marine, freshwater, and estuarine fish communities. Additionally, we discuss various applications of MiFish metabarcoding to non-fish organisms, single-species detection systems, quantitative biodiversity monitoring, and bulk DNA samples other than eDNA. By recognizing the MiFish eDNA metabarcoding strengths and limitations, we argue that this method is useful for ecosystem conservation strategies and the sustainable use of fishery resources in “ecosystem-based fishery management” through continuous biodiversity monitoring at multiple sites."

    There has been rapid development in tools for multivariate analysis based on
    fully specified statistical models or ‘joint models’. One approach
    attracting a lot of attention is generalized linear latent variable models
    (GLLVMs). However, software for fitting these models is typically slow and
    not practical for large datasets. The r package gllvm offers relatively fast
    methods to fit GLLVMs via maximum likelihood, along with tools for model
    checking, visualization and inference. The main advantage of the package
    over other implementations is speed, for example, being two orders of
    magnitude faster, and capable of handling thousands of response variables.
    These advances come from using variational approximations to simplify the
    likelihood expression to be maximized, automatic differentiation software
    for model-fitting (via the TMB package) and careful choice of initial values
    for parameters. Examples are used to illustrate the main features and
    functionality of the package, such as constrained or unconstrained
    ordination, including functional traits in ‘fourth corner’ models, and (if
    the number of environmental coefficients is not large) make inferences about
    environmental associations.

    Most complex systems in the real world are driven by multiple interactions
    among components. Identifying these interactions is critical for
    understanding, forecasting, and controlling system-level phenomena. Transfer
    entropy (TE) and convergent cross mapping (CCM) are two approaches for
    nonparametric causality detection based on time-series data that enable the
    identification of interactions with the minimal need for system
    intervention. However, the theoretical relationship between TE and CCM has
    not been formally explained. Here, we provide a theoretical formulation that
    links TE and CCM, based on different definitions of causal influence, in an
    information-theoretic framework. Furthermore, from the formulation, we
    propose a novel nonparametric causality test, named unified
    information-theoretic causality (UIC), which has lower data requirements
    than those of TE (due to robustness to noise) and lower false-positive rates
    than those of CCM. Numerical experiments confirmed that UIC outperforms TE
    and CCM in terms of the performance of causality detection for both linear
    and nonlinear dynamical systems. Finally, we demonstrate the practical
    importance of the conditional test based on UIC using numerical simulations
    with indirect causality and empirical data for microbial communities in
    irrigated water samples from rice fields. Our results contribute to a
    unified understanding of nonparametric causality tests in time series and
    the accurate reconstruction of complex real-world systems.

    Significance Statement Complex systems with multiple interacting components
    are common in a wide range of scientific fields, including economics,
    sociology, engineering, epidemiology, and ecology. Identifying interactions
    among components is necessary for understanding and predicting system-level
    phenomena. To this end, nonparametric causality tests based on time-series
    data have attracted attention. In this study, we provide a theoretical
    framework that integrates two major nonparametric causality tests, transfer
    entropy and convergent cross mapping. Furthermore, from the integrated
    framework, we propose a novel nonparametric causality test, named unified
    information-theoretic causality, which shows greater accuracy and efficiency
    compared with conventional methods. Our method enables the reconstruction of
    large interacting systems from multivariate time-series data and can provide
    insight into system-level phenomena, such as critical transitions.

  abstract: >-
    Estimating microbial association networks from high-throughput sequencing
    data is a common exploratory data analysis approach aiming at understanding
    the complex interplay of microbial communities in their natural habitat.
    Statistical network estimation workflows comprise several analysis steps,
    including methods for zero handling, data normalization and computing
    microbial associations. Since microbial interactions are likely to change
    between conditions, e.g. between healthy individuals and patients,
    identifying network differences between groups is often an integral
    secondary analysis step. Thus far, however, no unifying computational tool
    is available that facilitates the whole analysis workflow of constructing,
    analysing and comparing microbial association networks from high-throughput
    sequencing data.Here, we introduce NetCoMi (Network Construction and
    comparison for Microbiome data), an R package that integrates existing
    methods for each analysis step in a single reproducible computational
    workflow. The package offers functionality for constructing and analysing
    single microbial association networks as well as quantifying network
    differences. This enables insights into whether single taxa, groups of taxa
    or the overall network structure change between groups. NetCoMi also
    contains functionality for constructing differential networks, thus allowing
    to assess whether single pairs of taxa are differentially associated between
    two groups. Furthermore, NetCoMi facilitates the construction and analysis
    of dissimilarity networks of microbiome samples, enabling a high-level
    graphical summary of the heterogeneity of an entire microbiome sample
    collection. We illustrate NetCoMi’s wide applicability using data sets from
    the GABRIELA study to compare microbial associations in settled dust from
    children’s rooms between samples from two study centers (Ulm and Munich).R
    scripts used for producing the examples shown in this manuscript are
    provided as supplementary data. The NetCoMi package, together with a
    tutorial, is available at https://github.com/stefpeschel/NetCoMi.Tel:+49 89

    Background VSEARCH is an open source and free of charge multithreaded 64-bit
    tool for processing and preparing metagenomics, genomics and population
    genomics nucleotide sequence data. It is designed as an alternative to the
    widely used USEARCH tool (Edgar, 2010) for which the source code is not
    publicly available, algorithm details are only rudimentarily described, and
    only a memory-confined 32-bit version is freely available for academic use.
    Methods When searching nucleotide sequences, VSEARCH uses a fast heuristic
    based on words shared by the query and target sequences in order to quickly
    identify similar sequences, a similar strategy is probably used in USEARCH.
    VSEARCH then performs optimal global sequence alignment of the query against
    potential target sequences, using full dynamic programming instead of the
    seed-and-extend heuristic used by USEARCH. Pairwise alignments are computed
    in parallel using vectorisation and multiple threads. Results VSEARCH
    includes most commands for analysing nucleotide sequences available in
    USEARCH version 7 and several of those available in USEARCH version 8,
    including searching (exact or based on global alignment), clustering by
    similarity (using length pre-sorting, abundance pre-sorting or a
    user-defined order), chimera detection (reference-based or de novo),
    dereplication (full length or prefix), pairwise alignment, reverse
    complementation, sorting, and subsampling. VSEARCH also includes commands
    for FASTQ file processing, i.e., format detection, filtering, read quality
    statistics, and merging of paired reads. Furthermore, VSEARCH extends
    functionality with several new commands and improvements, including
    shuffling, rereplication, masking of low-complexity sequences with the
    well-known DUST algorithm, a choice among different similarity definitions,
    and FASTQ file format conversion. VSEARCH is here shown to be more accurate
    than USEARCH when performing searching, clustering, chimera detection and
    subsampling, while on a par with USEARCH for paired-ends read merging.
    VSEARCH is slower than USEARCH when performing clustering and chimera
    detection, but significantly faster when performing paired-end reads merging
    and dereplication. VSEARCH is available at
    https://github.com/torognes/vsearch under either the BSD 2-clause license or
    the GNU General Public License version 3.0. Discussion VSEARCH has been
    shown to be a fast, accurate and full-fledged alternative to USEARCH. A free
    and open-source versatile tool for sequence analysis is now available to the
    metagenomics community.

    Biodiversity monitoring is important for the conservation of natural
    ecosystems in general, but particularly for amphibians, whose populations
    are pronouncedly declining. However, amphibians’ ecological traits (e.g.
    nocturnal or aquatic) often prevent their precise monitoring. Environmental
    DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding – analysis of extra-organismal DNA released into
    the environment – allows the easy and effective monitoring of the
    biodiversity of aquatic organisms. Here, we developed and tested the utility
    of original PCR primer sets. First, we conducted in vitro PCR amplification
    tests with universal primer candidates using total DNA extracted from
    amphibian tissues. Five primer sets successfully amplified the target DNA
    fragments (partial 16S rRNA gene fragments of 160–311 bp) from all 16 taxa
    tested (from the three living amphibian orders Anura, Caudata and
    Gymnophiona). Next, we investigated the taxonomic resolution retrieved using
    each primer set. The results revealed that the universal primer set
    “Amph16S” had the highest resolution amongst the tested sets. Finally, we
    applied Amph16S to the water samples collected in the field and evaluated
    its detection capability by comparing the species detected using eDNA and
    physical survey (capture-based sampling and visual survey) in multiple
    agricultural ecosystems across Japan (160 sites in 10 areas). The eDNA
    metabarcoding with Amph16S detected twice as many species as the physical
    surveys (16 vs. 8 species, respectively), indicating the effectiveness of
    Amph16S in biodiversity monitoring and ecological research for amphibian
    communities.

    DNA barcoding is a powerful tool that provides rapid, accurate, and
    automatable species identification using standardized genetic region(s),
    such as for revealing the existence of cryptic species and/or rare species
    in biodiversity monitoring. DNA barcoding techniques require the development
    of sets of universal PCR primers for DNA barcoding. We tried to develop
    universal primer sets, and succeeded in designing not only universal primer
    sets for DNA barcoding regions of almost all insects, which were designed to
    include a hypervariable site between highly conserved sites, but also primer
    sets for longer fragment sequences for registration in a database. We
    confirmed successful amplification for 14 orders, 43 families, and 68
    species with DNA barcoding in the mtDNA 16S rRNA region, and for 13 orders,
    42 families, and 66 species with DNA barcoding in the mtDNA 12S rRNA region,
    including Apterygota and Pterygota (Paleoptera, Polyneoptera, Paraneoptera,
    and Oligoneoptera). A key feature is that the DNA fragments of the DNA
    barcoding regions amplified by these primer sets are both short at about
    200-bp, and longer fragment sequences will increase the level of data
    registration in the DNA database. In addition, we evaluated the sensitivity
    of these newly developed primers using Epeorus aesculus (Heptageniidae),
    which inhabits a relatively wide range of river systems. The results of this
    study revealed the existence of a cryptic species or an undescribed species.
    Such resulting database enhancements will provide opportunities for
    increasingly accurate assessment of biodiversity and genetic diversity.

    Taxonomic identification of biological specimens based on DNA sequence
    information (a.k.a. DNA barcoding) is becoming increasingly common in
    biodiversity science. Although several methods have been proposed, many of
    them are not universally applicable due to the need for prerequisite
    phylogenetic/machine-learning analyses, the need for huge computational
    resources, or the lack of a firm theoretical background. Here, we propose
    two new computational methods of DNA barcoding and show a benchmark for
    bacterial/archeal 16S, animal COX1, fungal internal transcribed spacer, and
    three plant chloroplast (rbcL, matK, and trnH-psbA) barcode loci that can be
    used to compare the performance of existing and new methods. The benchmark
    was performed under two alternative situations: query sequences were
    available in the corresponding reference sequence databases in one, but were
    not available in the other. In the former situation, the commonly used
    “1-nearest-neighbor” (1-NN) method, which assigns the taxonomic information
    of the most similar sequences in a reference database (i.e., BLAST-top-hit
    reference sequence) to a query, displays the highest rate and highest
    precision of successful taxonomic identification. However, in the latter
    situation, the 1-NN method produced extremely high rates of
    misidentification for all the barcode loci examined. In contrast, one of our
    new methods, the query-centric auto-k-nearest-neighbor (QCauto) method,
    consistently produced low rates of misidentification for all the loci
    examined in both situations. These results indicate that the 1-NN method is
    most suitable if the reference sequences of all potentially observable
    species are available in databases; otherwise, the QCauto method returns the
    most reliable identification results. The benchmark results also indicated
    that the taxon coverage of reference sequences is far from complete for
    genus or species level identification in all the barcode loci examined.
    Therefore, we need to accelerate the registration of reference barcode
    sequences to apply high-throughput DNA barcoding to genus or species level
    identification in biodiversity research.

    Joint Species Distribution Modelling (JSDM) is becoming an increasingly
    popular statistical method for analysing data in community ecology.
    Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) is a general and
    flexible framework for fitting JSDMs. HMSC allows the integration of
    community ecology data with data on environmental covariates, species
    traits, phylogenetic relationships and the spatio-temporal context of the
    study, providing predictive insights into community assembly processes from
    non-manipulative observational data of species communities. The full range
    of functionality of HMSC has remained restricted to Matlab users only. To
    make HMSC accessible to the wider community of ecologists, we introduce Hmsc
    3.0, a user-friendly r implementation. We illustrate the use of the package
    by applying Hmsc 3.0 to a range of case studies on real and simulated data.
    The real data consist of bird counts in a spatio-temporally structured
    dataset, environmental covariates, species traits and phylogenetic
    relationships. Vignettes on simulated data involve single-species models,
    models of small communities, models of large species communities and models
    for large spatial data. We demonstrate the estimation of species responses
    to environmental covariates and how these depend on species traits, as well
    as the estimation of residual species associations. We demonstrate how to
    construct and fit models with different types of random effects, how to
    examine MCMC convergence, how to examine the explanatory and predictive
    powers of the models, how to assess parameter estimates and how to make
    predictions. We further demonstrate how Hmsc 3.0 can be applied to normally
    distributed data, count data and presence–absence data. The package, along
    with the extended vignettes, makes JSDM fitting and post-processing easily
    accessible to ecologists familiar with r.

    Terrestrial animals must have frequent contact with water to survive,
    implying that environmental DNA (eDNA) originating from those animals should
    be detectable from places containing water in terrestrial ecosystems. Aiming
    to detect the presence of terrestrial mammals using forest water samples, we
    applied a set of universal PCR primers (MiMammal, a modified version of fish
    universal primers) for metabarcoding mammalian eDNA. The versatility of
    MiMammal primers was tested in silico and by amplifying DNAs extracted from
    tissues. The results suggested that MiMammal primers are capable of
    amplifying and distinguishing a diverse group of mammalian species. In
    addition, analyses of water samples from zoo cages of mammals with known
    species composition suggested that MiMammal primers could successfully
    detect mammalian species from water samples in the field. Then, we performed
    an experiment to detect mammals from natural ecosystems by collecting five
    500-ml water samples from ponds in two cool-temperate forests in Hokkaido,
    northern Japan. MiMammal amplicon libraries were constructed using eDNA
    extracted from water samples, and sequences generated by Illumina MiSeq were
    subjected to data processing and taxonomic assignment. We thereby detected
    multiple species of mammals common to the sampling areas, including deer
    (Cervus nippon), mouse (Mus musculus), vole (Myodes rufocanus), raccoon
    (Procyon lotor), rat (Rattus norvegicus) and shrew (Sorex unguiculatus).
    Many previous applications of the eDNA metabarcoding approach have been
    limited to aquatic/semiaquatic systems, but the results presented here show
    that the approach is also promising even for forest mammal biodiversity
    surveys.

    Birds play unique functional roles in the maintenance of ecosystems, such as
    pollination and seed dispersal, and thus monitoring bird species diversity
    is a first step towards avoiding undesirable consequences of anthropogenic
    impacts on bird communities. In the present study, we hypothesized that
    birds, regardless of their main habitats, must have frequent contact with
    water and that tissues that contain their DNA that persists in the
    environment (environmental DNA; eDNA) could be used to detect the presence
    of avian species. To this end, we applied a set of universal PCR primers
    (MiBird, a modified version of fish/mammal universal primers) for
    metabarcoding avian eDNA. We confirmed the versatility of MiBird primers by
    performing in silico analyses and by amplifying DNAs extracted from bird
    tissues. Analyses of water samples from zoo cages of birds with known
    species composition suggested that the use of MiBird primers combined with
    Illumina MiSeq could successfully detect avian species from water samples.
    Additionally, analysis of water samples collected from a natural pond
    detected five avian species common to the sampling areas. The present
    findings suggest that avian eDNA metabarcoding would be a complementary
    detection/identification tool in cases where visual census of bird species
    is difficult.

  abstract: >-
    Effective ecosystem conservation and resource management require
    quantitative monitoring of biodiversity, including accurate descriptions of
    species composition and temporal variations of species abundance.
    Accordingly, quantitative monitoring of biodiversity has been performed for
    many ecosystems, but it is often time- and effort-consuming and costly.
    Recent studies have shown that environmental DNA (eDNA), which is released
    to the environment from macro-organisms living in a habitat, contains
    information about species identity and abundance. Thus, analysing eDNA would
    be a promising approach for more efficient biodiversity monitoring. In the
    present study, internal standard DNAs (i.e. known amounts of short DNA
    fragments from fish species that have never been observed in a sampling
    area) were added to eDNA samples, which were collected weekly from a coastal
    marine ecosystem in Maizuru Bay, Japan (from April 2015 to March 2016) and
    metabarcoding analysis was performed using Illumina MiSeq to simultaneously
    identify fish species and quantify fish eDNA copy numbers. A correction
    equation was obtained for each sample using the relationship between the
    number of sequence reads and the added amount of the standard DNAs and this
    equation was used to estimate the copy numbers from the sequence reads of
    non-standard fish eDNA. The calculated copy numbers showed significant
    positive correlations with those determined by quantitative PCR, suggesting
    that eDNA metabarcoding with standard DNA enabled useful quantification of
    eDNA. Furthermore, for samples that show a high level of PCR inhibition,
    this method might allow more accurate quantification than qPCR because the
    correction equations generated using internal standard DNAs would include
    the effect of PCR inhibition. A single run of Illumina MiSeq produced &gt;70
    quantitative fish eDNA time series in this study, showing that this method
    could contribute to more efficient and quantitative monitoring of
    biodiversity.

  abstract: >-
    Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding, a method that applies
    high-throughput sequencing and universal primer sets to eDNA analysis, has
    been a promising approach for efficient, comprehensive biodiversity
    monitoring. However, significant money-, labor-, and time-costs are still
    required for performing eDNA metabarcoding. In this study, we assessed the
    performance of an “early-pooling” protocol (a protocol based on 1st PCR
    tagging) to reduce the experimental costs of library preparation for eDNA
    metabarcoding. Specifically, we performed three experiments to investigate
    the effects of 1st PCR-tagging and 2nd PCR-indexing protocols on the
    community composition revealed by eDNA metabarcoding, the effects of
    post-1st PCR exonuclease purification on tag jumping (corresponds to index
    hopping in 2nd PCR indexing), and the effects of the number of PCR
    replicates and the eDNA template volume on the number of detected OTUs.
    Analyses of 204 eDNA libraries from three natural aquatic ecosystems and one
    mock eDNA sample showed that (i) 1st PCR tagging does not cause clear biases
    in the outcomes of eDNA metabarcoding, (ii) post-1st PCR exonuclease
    purification reduces the risk of tag jumping, and (iii) increasing the eDNA
    template volume may increase the number of detected OTUs and reduce
    variations in the detected community compositions, similar to increasing the
    number of 1st PCR replicates. Our results show that an early-pooling
    protocol with post-1st PCR exonuclease purification and an increased amount
    of the DNA template reduces the risk of tag jumping, the costs for
    consumables and reagents (except for many tagged 1st PCR primers), and the
    handling time in library preparation, and produces similar results to a 2nd
    PCR-indexing protocol. Therefore, once a target metabarcoding region is
    selected and a set of tagged-1st PCR primers is prepared, the early-pooling
    protocol provides a cost, labor, and time-efficient approach for processing
    a large number of samples.

    Technological advances have enabled a new class of multivariate models for
    ecology, with the potential now to specify a statistical model for
    abundances jointly across many taxa, to simultaneously explore interactions
    across taxa and the response of abundance to environmental variables. Joint
    models can be used for several purposes of interest to ecologists, including
    estimating patterns of residual correlation across taxa, ordination,
    multivariate inference about environmental effects and environment-by-trait
    interactions, accounting for missing predictors, and improving predictions
    in situations where one can leverage knowledge of some species to predict
    others. We demonstrate this by example and discuss recent computation tools
    and future directions.

    The network analysis has attracted increasing attention and interest from
    ecological academics, thus it is of great necessity to develop more
    convenient and powerful tools. For that reason, we have developed an R
    package, named “ggClusterNet,” to complete and display the network analysis
    in an easier manner. In that package, ten network layout algorithms are
    designed to better display the modules of microbiome network
    (randomClusterG, PolygonClusterG, PolygonRrClusterG, ArtifCluster,
    randSNEClusterG, PolygonModsquareG, PolyRdmNotdCirG, model_Gephi.2,
    model_igraph, and model_maptree). For the convenience of the users, many
    functions related to microbial network analysis, such as corMicor(),
    net_properties(), node_properties(), ZiPiPlot(), random_Net_compate(), are
    integrated to complete the network mining. Furthermore, the pipeline
    function named network.2() and corBionetwork() are also added for the quick
    achievement of the network or bipartite network analysis as well as their
    in-depth mining. The ggClusterNet is publicly available via GitHub
    (https://github.com/taowenmicro/ggClusterNet/) or Gitee
    (https://gitee.com/wentaomicro/ggClusterNet) for users' access. A complete
    description of the usages can be found on the manuscript's GitHub page
    (https://github.com/taowenmicro/ggClusterNet/wiki).

    In ecological analysis, complexity has been regarded as an obstacle to
    overcome. Here we present a straightforward approach for addressing
    complexity in dynamic interconnected systems. We show that complexity, in
    the form of multiple interacting components, can actually be an asset for
    studying natural systems from temporal data. The central idea is that
    multidimensional time series enable system dynamics to be reconstructed from
    multiple viewpoints, and these viewpoints can be combined into a single
    model. We show how our approach, multiview embedding (MVE), can improve
    forecasts for simulated ecosystems and a mesocosm experiment. By leveraging
    complexity, MVE is particularly effective for overcoming the limitations of
    short and noisy time series and should be highly relevant for many areas of
    science.

    MitoFish, MitoAnnotator, and MiFish Pipeline are comprehensive databases of
    fish mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes), accurate annotation software of
    fish mitogenomes, and a web platform for metabarcoding analysis of fish
    mitochondrial environmental DNA (eDNA), respectively. The MitoFish Suite
    currently receives over 48,000 visits worldwide every year; however, the
    performance and usefulness of the online platforms can still be improved.
    Here, we present essential updates on these platforms, including an
    enrichment of the reference data sets, an enhanced searching function,
    substantially faster genome annotation and eDNA analysis with the denoising
    of sequencing errors, and a multisample comparative analysis function. These
    updates have made our platform more intuitive, effective, and reliable.
    These updated platforms are freely available at
    http://mitofish.aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp/.

- id: 土居2011生物群集解析のための類似度とその応用Rを使った類似度の算出グラフ化
  abstract: >-
    群集生態学では、古くから類似度指数を用いた解析が頻繁に用いられてきた。しかし近年、汎用性の高い新たな類似度や検定手法が提案されているにもかかわらず、それらが十分に普及し利用されているとは言い難い。そこで、本総説では、現在までに発表されている代表的で有用な類似度、それを使ったグラフ表示、統計的検定について解説を行う。各類似度の成り立ち、指数ごとの特性、利用方法について初学者向けの説明を試みる。各種手法の理解の助けのため、統計ソフトRのveganパッケージを用いた分析を取り上げ、例題や付録のRコードを用いてveganによる解析手順を紹介する。利用実態としては、Jaccard指数など古くから提案されている指数が近年でも多く用いられているが、Chaoによって近年開発された指数は希少種を考慮した汎用性の高い類似度指数として優れており、Chao指数の利用が促進されることが望ましい。また、類似度を用いた検定についてもPERMANOVAなどの新しい統計手法の利用が図られるべきである。今後の群集解析において、これらの手法が取り入れられることにより、より適切な生態系の評価が行われ、新たな発見につながることが期待される。
