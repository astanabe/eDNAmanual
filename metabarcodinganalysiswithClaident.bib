  abstract = {We propose an integrated sampling, rarefaction, and extrapolation methodology to compare species richness of a set of communities based on samples of equal completeness (as measured by sample coverage) instead of equal size. Traditional rarefaction or extrapolation to equal-sized samples can misrepresent the relationships between the richnesses of the communities being compared because a sample of a given size may be sufficient to fully characterize the lower diversity community, but insufficient to characterize the richer community. Thus, the traditional method systematically biases the degree of differences between community richnesses. We derived a new analytic method for seamless coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation. We show that this method yields less biased comparisons of richness between communities, and manages this with less total sampling effort. When this approach is integrated with an adaptive coverage-based stopping rule during sampling, samples may be compared directly without rarefaction, so no extra data is taken and none is thrown away. Even if this stopping rule is not used during data collection, coverage-based rarefaction throws away less data than traditional size-based rarefaction, and more efficiently finds the correct ranking of communities according to their true richnesses. Several hypothetical and real examples demonstrate these advantages.},

  abstract = {Quantifying and assessing changes in biological diversity are central aspects of many ecological studies, yet accurate methods of estimating biological diversity from sampling data have been elusive. Hill numbers, or the effective number of species, are increasingly used to characterize the taxonomic, phylogenetic, or functional diversity of an assemblage. However, empirical estimates of Hill numbers, including species richness, tend to be an increasing function of sampling effort and, thus, tend to increase with sample completeness. Integrated curves based on sampling theory that smoothly link rarefaction (interpolation) and prediction (extrapolation) standardize samples on the basis of sample size or sample completeness and facilitate the comparison of biodiversity data. Here we extended previous rarefaction and extrapolation models for species richness (Hill number qD, where q = 0) to measures of taxon diversity incorporating relative abundance (i.e., for any Hill number qD, q {$>$} 0) and present a unified approach for both individual-based (abundance) data and sample-based (incidence) data. Using this unified sampling framework, we derive both theoretical formulas and analytic estimators for seamless rarefaction and extrapolation based on Hill numbers. Detailed examples are provided for the first three Hill numbers: q = 0 (species richness), q = 1 (the exponential of Shannon's entropy index), and q = 2 (the inverse of Simpson's concentration index). We developed a bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals around Hill numbers, facilitating the comparison of multiple assemblages of both rarefied and extrapolated samples. The proposed estimators are accurate for both rarefaction and short-range extrapolation. For long-range extrapolation, the performance of the estimators depends on both the value of q and on the extrapolation range. We tested our methods on simulated data generated from species abundance models and on data from large species inventories. We also illustrate the formulas and estimators using empirical data sets from biodiversity surveys of temperate forest spiders and tropical ants.},

  abstract = {Based on sampling data, we propose a rigorous standardization method to measure and compare beta diversity across datasets. Here beta diversity, which quantifies the extent of among-assemblage differentiation, relies on Whittaker's original multiplicative decomposition scheme, but we use Hill numbers for any diversity order q ≥ 0. Richness-based beta diversity (q = 0) quantifies the extent of species identity shift, whereas abundance-based (q {$>$} 0) beta diversity also quantifies the extent of difference among assemblages in species abundance. We adopt and define the assumptions of a statistical sampling model as the foundation for our approach, treating sampling data as a representative sample taken from an assemblage. The approach makes a clear distinction between the theoretical assemblage level (unknown properties/parameters of the assemblage) and the sampling data level (empirical/observed statistics computed from data). At the assemblage level, beta diversity for N assemblages reflects the interacting effect of the species abundance distribution and spatial/temporal aggregation of individuals in the assemblage. Under independent sampling, observed beta (= gamma/alpha) diversity depends not only on among-assemblage differentiation but also on sampling effort/completeness, which in turn induces dependence of beta on alpha and gamma diversity. How to remove the dependence of richness-based beta diversity on its gamma component (species pool) has been intensely debated. Our approach is to standardize gamma and alpha based on sample coverage (an objective measure of sample completeness). For a single assemblage, the iNEXT method was developed, through interpolation (rarefaction) and extrapolation with Hill numbers, to standardize samples by sampling effort/completeness. Here we adapt the iNEXT standardization to alpha and gamma diversity, that is, alpha and gamma diversity are both assessed at the same level of sample coverage, to formulate standardized, coverage-based beta diversity. This extension of iNEXT to beta diversity required the development of novel concepts and theories, including a formal proof and simulation-based demonstration that the resulting standardized beta diversity removes the dependence of beta diversity on both gamma and alpha values, and thus reflects the pure among-assemblage differentiation. The proposed standardization is illustrated with spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal datasets, while the freeware iNEXT.beta3D facilitates all computations and graphics.},

  abstract = {Estimating and comparing microbial diversity are statistically challenging due to limited sampling and possible sequencing errors for low-frequency counts, producing spurious singletons. The inflated singleton count seriously affects statistical analysis and inferences about microbial diversity. Previous statistical approaches to tackle the sequencing errors generally require different parametric assumptions about the sampling model or about the functional form of frequency counts. Different parametric assumptions may lead to drastically different diversity estimates. We focus on nonparametric methods which are universally valid for all parametric assumptions and can be used to compare diversity across communities. We develop here a nonparametric estimator of the true singleton count to replace the spurious singleton count in all methods/approaches. Our estimator of the true singleton count is in terms of the frequency counts of doubletons, tripletons and quadrupletons, provided these three frequency counts are reliable. To quantify microbial alpha diversity for an individual community, we adopt the measure of Hill numbers (effective number of taxa) under a nonparametric framework. Hill numbers, parameterized by an order q that determines the measures’ emphasis on rare or common species, include taxa richness (q = 0), Shannon diversity (q = 1, the exponential of Shannon entropy), and Simpson diversity (q = 2, the inverse of Simpson index). A diversity profile which depicts the Hill number as a function of order q conveys all information contained in a taxa abundance distribution. Based on the estimated singleton count and the original non-singleton frequency counts, two statistical approaches (non-asymptotic and asymptotic) are developed to compare microbial diversity for multiple communities. (1) A non-asymptotic approach refers to the comparison of estimated diversities of standardized samples with a common finite sample size or sample completeness. This approach aims to compare diversity estimates for equally-large or equally-complete samples; it is based on the seamless rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curves of Hill numbers, specifically for q = 0, 1 and 2. (2) An asymptotic approach refers to the comparison of the estimated asymptotic diversity profiles. That is, this approach compares the estimated profiles for complete samples or samples whose size tends to be sufficiently large. It is based on statistical estimation of the true Hill number of any order q ≥ 0. In the two approaches, replacing the spurious singleton count by our estimated count, we can greatly remove the positive biases associated with diversity estimates due to spurious singletons and also make fair comparisons across microbial communities, as illustrated in our simulation results and in applying our method to analyze sequencing data from viral metagenomes.},

Detection and removal of chimeras is therefore of critical importance in such experiments.Results: We describe UCHIME, a new program that detects chimeric sequences with two or more segments. UCHIME either uses a database of chimera-free sequences or detects chimeras de novo by exploiting abundance data. UCHIME has better sensitivity than ChimeraSlayer (previously the most sensitive database method), especially with short, noisy sequences. In testing on artificial bacterial communities with known composition, UCHIME de novo sensitivity is shown to be comparable to Perseus.

Here, we sequenced seven amplicon libraries prepared using various multiplexing designs in order to measure the magnitude of this phenomenon and its impact on diversity analyses. Up to 28.2\% of the unique sequences correspond to undetectable (critical) mistags in single- or saturated double-tagging libraries. We show the advantage of multiplexing samples following Latin Square Designs in order to optimize the detection of mistags and maximize the information on their distribution across samples. We use this information in designs incorporating PCR replicates to filter the critical mistags and to recover the exact composition of mock community samples. Being parameter-free and data-driven, our approach can provide more accurate and reproducible HTS data sets, improving the reliability of their interpretations.},

  abstract = {Metagenomics is the study of the genomic content of a sample of organisms obtained from a common habitat using targeted or random sequencing. Goals include understanding the extent and role of microbial diversity. The taxonomical content of such a sample is usually estimated by comparison against sequence databases of known sequences. Most published studies use the analysis of paired-end reads, complete sequences of environmental fosmid and BAC clones, or environmental assemblies. Emerging sequencing-by-synthesis technologies with very high throughput are paving the way to low-cost random “shotgun” approaches. This paper introduces MEGAN, a new computer program that allows laptop analysis of large metagenomic data sets. In a preprocessing step, the set of DNA sequences is compared against databases of known sequences using BLAST or another comparison tool. MEGAN is then used to compute and explore the taxonomical content of the data set, employing the NCBI taxonomy to summarize and order the results. A simple lowest common ancestor algorithm assigns reads to taxa such that the taxonomical level of the assigned taxon reflects the level of conservation of the sequence. The software allows large data sets to be dissected without the need for assembly or the targeting of specific phylogenetic markers. It provides graphical and statistical output for comparing different data sets. The approach is applied to several data sets, including the Sargasso Sea data set, a recently published metagenomic data set sampled from a mammoth bone, and several complete microbial genomes. Also, simulations that evaluate the performance of the approach for different read lengths are presented.},

  abstract = {Community ecology beginners often struggle to understand theories expressed in complex mathematical formulas and to master computer programming. To remedy this situation, this article provides a practical, R-based introduction to community ecology by illustrating core concepts (vital rates, carrying capacity, and density dependence) and models that can be used to explore the patterns of species abundance and diversity. The structure of this article consists of three modeling exercises, each asking a general question that can be answered by a combination of theory and R programming: (1) what determines the abundance of species, and what makes a population persist and go extinct?; (2) what determines the distribution of species and species diversity?; (3) what determines the relative abundance of species and what allows species to coexist? Through the exercises, I discuss the following five concepts and ideas that provide valuable insights into the questions: (i) the tragedy of the commons, (ii) the theory of island biogeography, (iii) competitive exclusion, (iv) the neutral theory of biodiversity, and (v) frequency dependence. These materials are thus designed to guide the reader in developing an intuition for ecological thinking that will help capture the essence of the global environmental and biodiversity crisis. Although this article does not delineate the scope and depth of the vast field of community ecology, I hope that it will motivate the reader to step up to a more formal introduction to community ecology.},

  abstract = {The Decapoda is one of the largest orders within the class Malacostraca, comprising approximately 14,000 extant species and including many commercially important species. For biodiversity monitoring in a non-invasive manner, a new set of PCR primers was developed for metabarcoding environmental DNA (eDNA) from decapod crustaceans. The new primers (herein named “MiDeca”) were designed for two conservative regions of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene, which amplify a short, hyper-variable region (153–184 bp, 164 bp on average) with sufficient interspecific variations. With the use of MiDeca primers and tissue-derived DNA extracts, we successfully determined those sequences (154–189 bp) from 250 species, placed in 186 genera and 65 families across the suborder Dendrobranchiata and 10 of the 11 infraorders of the suborder Pleocyemata. We also preliminarily attempted eDNA metabarcoding from natural seawater collected at Banda, Tateyama, the Pacific coast of central Japan and detected 42 decapod species including 34 and 8 species with sequence identities of \&gt; 98\% and 80–98\%, respectively. The results suggest the usefulness of eDNA metabarcoding with MiDeca primers for biodiversity monitoring of the decapod species. It appears, however, that further optimisation of primer sequences would still be necessary to avoid possible PCR dropouts from eDNA extracts.},

  abstract = {16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and other environmental sequencing techniques provide snapshots of microbial communities, revealing phylogeny and the abundances of microbial populations across diverse ecosystems. While changes in microbial community structure are demonstrably associated with certain environmental conditions (from metabolic and immunological health in mammals to ecological stability in soils and oceans), identification of underlying mechanisms requires new statistical tools, as these datasets present several technical challenges. First, the abundances of microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from amplicon-based datasets are compositional. Counts are normalized to the total number of counts in the sample. Thus, microbial abundances are not independent, and traditional statistical metrics (e.g., correlation) for the detection of OTU-OTU relationships can lead to spurious results. Secondly, microbial sequencing-based studies typically measure hundreds of OTUs on only tens to hundreds of samples; thus, inference of OTU-OTU association networks is severely under-powered, and additional information (or assumptions) are required for accurate inference. Here, we present SPIEC-EASI (SParse InversE Covariance Estimation for Ecological Association Inference), a statistical method for the inference of microbial ecological networks from amplicon sequencing datasets that addresses both of these issues. SPIEC-EASI combines data transformations developed for compositional data analysis with a graphical model inference framework that assumes the underlying ecological association network is sparse. To reconstruct the network, SPIEC-EASI relies on algorithms for sparse neighborhood and inverse covariance selection. To provide a synthetic benchmark in the absence of an experimentally validated gold-standard network, SPIEC-EASI is accompanied by a set of computational tools to generate OTU count data from a set of diverse underlying network topologies. SPIEC-EASI outperforms state-of-the-art methods to recover edges and network properties on synthetic data under a variety of scenarios. SPIEC-EASI also reproducibly predicts previously unknown microbial associations using data from the American Gut project.},

However, the value of the data that will accumulate would be greatly enhanced by standardizing the analysis methods, which would allow us to compare data from multiple monitoring sites at different points in time. The eDNA Society (http://ednasociety.org/en/about), whose founding members consist of Japanese researchers conducting eDNA studies on macro-organisms, was established in 2018, with the aim of expanding eDNA technology and science. Here, we introduce our key publication, “Environmental DNA Sampling and Experiment Manual” (http://ednasociety.org/en/manual), which was published under the initiative of the eDNA Society. Detailed methods for the surveys and experiments are described in the manual, including the selection of sampling sites, sampling methods, filtration methods, DNA extraction, species-specific detection by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and fish eDNA metabarcoding. The manual assists users in conducting standardized surveys and quality experiments, and provides a basis for collecting comparable data. Given that the efficacy of methods can be context dependent and variable, and that procedures may sometimes conflict with standardization, it is difficult to ensure that all processes are equally effective. However, even in such cases, it is important to maintain sufficiently high data quality by setting the minimum standards to be followed. Implementation of such standardized methodologies will enable the systematic and frequent collection of flawless, comparable eDNA data from around the world; this will provide important fundamental information for biodiversity conservation, as well as the sustainable use of fisheries resources.},

  abstract = {We developed a set of universal PCR primers (MiFish-U/E) for metabarcoding environmental DNA (eDNA) from fishes. Primers were designed using aligned whole mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequences from 880 species, supplemented by partial mitogenome sequences from 160 elasmobranchs (sharks and rays). The primers target a hypervariable region of the 12S rRNA gene (163–185\,bp), which contains sufficient information to identify fishes to taxonomic family, genus and species except for some closely related congeners. To test versatility of the primers across a diverse range of fishes, we sampled eDNA from four tanks in the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium with known species compositions, prepared dual-indexed libraries and performed paired-end sequencing of the region using high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies. Out of the 180 marine fish species contained in the four tanks with reference sequences in a custom database, we detected 168 species (93.3\%) distributed across 59 families and 123 genera. These fishes are not only taxonomically diverse, ranging from sharks and rays to higher teleosts, but are also greatly varied in their ecology, including both pelagic and benthic species living in shallow coastal to deep waters. We also sampled natural seawaters around coral reefs near the aquarium and detected 93 fish species using this approach. Of the 93 species, 64 were not detected in the four aquarium tanks, rendering the total number of species detected to 232 (from 70 families and 152 genera). The metabarcoding approach presented here is non-invasive, more efficient, more cost-effective and more sensitive than the traditional survey methods. It has the potential to serve as an alternative (or complementary) tool for biodiversity monitoring that revolutionizes natural resource management and ecological studies of fish communities on larger spatial and temporal scales.},

This method has mostly been applied to biodiversity monitoring using environmental DNA (eDNA) shed from fish and, coupled with next-generation sequencing technologies, has enabled massively parallel sequencing of several hundred eDNA samples simultaneously. Since the publication of its technical outline in 2015, this method has been widely used in various aquatic environments in and around the six continents, and MiFish primers have demonstrably outperformed other competing primers. Here, we outline the technical progress in this method over the last 5~years and highlight some case studies on marine, freshwater, and estuarine fish communities. Additionally, we discuss various applications of MiFish metabarcoding to non-fish organisms, single-species detection systems, quantitative biodiversity monitoring, and bulk DNA samples other than eDNA. By recognizing the MiFish eDNA metabarcoding strengths and limitations, we argue that this method is useful for ecosystem conservation strategies and the sustainable use of fishery resources in “ecosystem-based fishery management” through continuous biodiversity monitoring at multiple sites.},

One approach attracting a lot of attention is generalized linear latent variable models (GLLVMs). However, software for fitting these models is typically slow and not practical for large datasets. The r package gllvm offers relatively fast methods to fit GLLVMs via maximum likelihood, along with tools for model checking, visualization and inference. The main advantage of the package over other implementations is speed, for example, being two orders of magnitude faster, and capable of handling thousands of response variables. These advances come from using variational approximations to simplify the likelihood expression to be maximized, automatic differentiation software for model-fitting (via the TMB package) and careful choice of initial values for parameters. Examples are used to illustrate the main features and functionality of the package, such as constrained or unconstrained ordination, including functional traits in ‘fourth corner’ models, and (if the number of environmental coefficients is not large) make inferences about environmental associations.},

  abstract = {Most complex systems in the real world are driven by multiple interactions among components. Identifying these interactions is critical for understanding, forecasting, and controlling system-level phenomena. Transfer entropy (TE) and convergent cross mapping (CCM) are two approaches for nonparametric causality detection based on time-series data that enable the identification of interactions with the minimal need for system intervention. However, the theoretical relationship between TE and CCM has not been formally explained. Here, we provide a theoretical formulation that links TE and CCM, based on different definitions of causal influence, in an information-theoretic framework. Furthermore, from the formulation, we propose a novel nonparametric causality test, named unified information-theoretic causality (UIC), which has lower data requirements than those of TE (due to robustness to noise) and lower false-positive rates than those of CCM. Numerical experiments confirmed that UIC outperforms TE and CCM in terms of the performance of causality detection for both linear and nonlinear dynamical systems. Finally, we demonstrate the practical importance of the conditional test based on UIC using numerical simulations with indirect causality and empirical data for microbial communities in irrigated water samples from rice fields. Our results contribute to a unified understanding of nonparametric causality tests in time series and the accurate reconstruction of complex real-world systems. Significance Statement Complex systems with multiple interacting components are common in a wide range of scientific fields, including economics, sociology, engineering, epidemiology, and ecology. Identifying interactions among components is necessary for understanding and predicting system-level phenomena. To this end, nonparametric causality tests based on time-series data have attracted attention. In this study, we provide a theoretical framework that integrates two major nonparametric causality tests, transfer entropy and convergent cross mapping. Furthermore, from the integrated framework, we propose a novel nonparametric causality test, named unified information-theoretic causality, which shows greater accuracy and efficiency compared with conventional methods. Our method enables the reconstruction of large interacting systems from multivariate time-series data and can provide insight into system-level phenomena, such as critical transitions.},

  abstract = {Estimating microbial association networks from high-throughput sequencing data is a common exploratory data analysis approach aiming at understanding the complex interplay of microbial communities in their natural habitat. Statistical network estimation workflows comprise several analysis steps, including methods for zero handling, data normalization and computing microbial associations. Since microbial interactions are likely to change between conditions, e.g. between healthy individuals and patients, identifying network differences between groups is often an integral secondary analysis step. Thus far, however, no unifying computational tool is available that facilitates the whole analysis workflow of constructing, analysing and comparing microbial association networks from high-throughput sequencing data.Here, we introduce NetCoMi (Network Construction and comparison for Microbiome data), an R package that integrates existing methods for each analysis step in a single reproducible computational workflow. The package offers functionality for constructing and analysing single microbial association networks as well as quantifying network differences. This enables insights into whether single taxa, groups of taxa or the overall network structure change between groups. NetCoMi also contains functionality for constructing differential networks, thus allowing to assess whether single pairs of taxa are differentially associated between two groups. Furthermore, NetCoMi facilitates the construction and analysis of dissimilarity networks of microbiome samples, enabling a high-level graphical summary of the heterogeneity of an entire microbiome sample collection. We illustrate NetCoMi’s wide applicability using data sets from the GABRIELA study to compare microbial associations in settled dust from children’s rooms between samples from two study centers (Ulm and Munich).R scripts used for producing the examples shown in this manuscript are provided as supplementary data. The NetCoMi package, together with a tutorial, is available at https://github.com/stefpeschel/NetCoMi.Tel:+49 89 3187 43258; stefanie.peschel@mail.deSupplementary data are available at Briefings in Bioinformatics online.},

It is designed as an alternative to the widely used USEARCH tool (Edgar, 2010) for which the source code is not publicly available, algorithm details are only rudimentarily described, and only a memory-confined 32-bit version is freely available for academic use. Methods When searching nucleotide sequences, VSEARCH uses a fast heuristic based on words shared by the query and target sequences in order to quickly identify similar sequences, a similar strategy is probably used in USEARCH. VSEARCH then performs optimal global sequence alignment of the query against potential target sequences, using full dynamic programming instead of the seed-and-extend heuristic used by USEARCH. Pairwise alignments are computed in parallel using vectorisation and multiple threads. Results VSEARCH includes most commands for analysing nucleotide sequences available in USEARCH version 7 and several of those available in USEARCH version 8, including searching (exact or based on global alignment), clustering by similarity (using length pre-sorting, abundance pre-sorting or a user-defined order), chimera detection (reference-based or de novo), dereplication (full length or prefix), pairwise alignment, reverse complementation, sorting, and subsampling. VSEARCH also includes commands for FASTQ file processing, i.e., format detection, filtering, read quality statistics, and merging of paired reads. Furthermore, VSEARCH extends functionality with several new commands and improvements, including shuffling, rereplication, masking of low-complexity sequences with the well-known DUST algorithm, a choice among different similarity definitions, and FASTQ file format conversion. VSEARCH is here shown to be more accurate than USEARCH when performing searching, clustering, chimera detection and subsampling, while on a par with USEARCH for paired-ends read merging. VSEARCH is slower than USEARCH when performing clustering and chimera detection, but significantly faster when performing paired-end reads merging and dereplication. VSEARCH is available at https://github.com/torognes/vsearch under either the BSD 2-clause license or the GNU General Public License version 3.0. Discussion VSEARCH has been shown to be a fast, accurate and full-fledged alternative to USEARCH. A free and open-source versatile tool for sequence analysis is now available to the metagenomics community.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity monitoring is important for the conservation of natural ecosystems in general, but particularly for amphibians, whose populations are pronouncedly declining. However, amphibians’ ecological traits (e.g. nocturnal or aquatic) often prevent their precise monitoring. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding – analysis of extra-organismal DNA released into the environment – allows the easy and effective monitoring of the biodiversity of aquatic organisms. Here, we developed and tested the utility of original PCR primer sets. First, we conducted in vitro PCR amplification tests with universal primer candidates using total DNA extracted from amphibian tissues. Five primer sets successfully amplified the target DNA fragments (partial 16S rRNA gene fragments of 160–311 bp) from all 16 taxa tested (from the three living amphibian orders Anura, Caudata and Gymnophiona). Next, we investigated the taxonomic resolution retrieved using each primer set. The results revealed that the universal primer set “Amph16S” had the highest resolution amongst the tested sets. Finally, we applied Amph16S to the water samples collected in the field and evaluated its detection capability by comparing the species detected using eDNA and physical survey (capture-based sampling and visual survey) in multiple agricultural ecosystems across Japan (160 sites in 10 areas). The eDNA metabarcoding with Amph16S detected twice as many species as the physical surveys (16 vs. 8 species, respectively), indicating the effectiveness of Amph16S in biodiversity monitoring and ecological research for amphibian communities.},

DNA barcoding techniques require the development of sets of universal PCR primers for DNA barcoding. We tried to develop universal primer sets, and succeeded in designing not only universal primer sets for DNA barcoding regions of almost all insects, which were designed to include a hypervariable site between highly conserved sites, but also primer sets for longer fragment sequences for registration in a database. We confirmed successful amplification for 14 orders, 43 families, and 68 species with DNA barcoding in the mtDNA 16S rRNA region, and for 13 orders, 42 families, and 66 species with DNA barcoding in the mtDNA 12S rRNA region, including Apterygota and Pterygota (Paleoptera, Polyneoptera, Paraneoptera, and Oligoneoptera). A key feature is that the DNA fragments of the DNA barcoding regions amplified by these primer sets are both short at about 200-bp, and longer fragment sequences will increase the level of data registration in the DNA database. In addition, we evaluated the sensitivity of these newly developed primers using Epeorus aesculus (Heptageniidae), which inhabits a relatively wide range of river systems. The results of this study revealed the existence of a cryptic species or an undescribed species. Such resulting database enhancements will provide opportunities for increasingly accurate assessment of biodiversity and genetic diversity.},

  abstract = {Taxonomic identification of biological specimens based on DNA sequence information (a.k.a. DNA barcoding) is becoming increasingly common in biodiversity science. Although several methods have been proposed, many of them are not universally applicable due to the need for prerequisite phylogenetic/machine-learning analyses, the need for huge computational resources, or the lack of a firm theoretical background. Here, we propose two new computational methods of DNA barcoding and show a benchmark for bacterial/archeal 16S, animal COX1, fungal internal transcribed spacer, and three plant chloroplast (rbcL, matK, and trnH-psbA) barcode loci that can be used to compare the performance of existing and new methods. The benchmark was performed under two alternative situations: query sequences were available in the corresponding reference sequence databases in one, but were not available in the other. In the former situation, the commonly used “1-nearest-neighbor” (1-NN) method, which assigns the taxonomic information of the most similar sequences in a reference database (i.e., BLAST-top-hit reference sequence) to a query, displays the highest rate and highest precision of successful taxonomic identification. However, in the latter situation, the 1-NN method produced extremely high rates of misidentification for all the barcode loci examined. In contrast, one of our new methods, the query-centric auto-k-nearest-neighbor (QCauto) method, consistently produced low rates of misidentification for all the loci examined in both situations. These results indicate that the 1-NN method is most suitable if the reference sequences of all potentially observable species are available in databases; otherwise, the QCauto method returns the most reliable identification results. The benchmark results also indicated that the taxon coverage of reference sequences is far from complete for genus or species level identification in all the barcode loci examined. Therefore, we need to accelerate the registration of reference barcode sequences to apply high-throughput DNA barcoding to genus or species level identification in biodiversity research.},

  abstract = {Joint Species Distribution Modelling (JSDM) is becoming an increasingly popular statistical method for analysing data in community ecology. Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) is a general and flexible framework for fitting JSDMs. HMSC allows the integration of community ecology data with data on environmental covariates, species traits, phylogenetic relationships and the spatio-temporal context of the study, providing predictive insights into community assembly processes from non-manipulative observational data of species communities. The full range of functionality of HMSC has remained restricted to Matlab users only. To make HMSC accessible to the wider community of ecologists, we introduce Hmsc 3.0, a user-friendly r implementation. We illustrate the use of the package by applying Hmsc 3.0 to a range of case studies on real and simulated data. The real data consist of bird counts in a spatio-temporally structured dataset, environmental covariates, species traits and phylogenetic relationships. Vignettes on simulated data involve single-species models, models of small communities, models of large species communities and models for large spatial data. We demonstrate the estimation of species responses to environmental covariates and how these depend on species traits, as well as the estimation of residual species associations. We demonstrate how to construct and fit models with different types of random effects, how to examine MCMC convergence, how to examine the explanatory and predictive powers of the models, how to assess parameter estimates and how to make predictions. We further demonstrate how Hmsc 3.0 can be applied to normally distributed data, count data and presence–absence data. The package, along with the extended vignettes, makes JSDM fitting and post-processing easily accessible to ecologists familiar with r.},

Aiming to detect the presence of terrestrial mammals using forest water samples, we applied a set of universal PCR primers (MiMammal, a modified version of fish universal primers) for metabarcoding mammalian eDNA. The versatility of MiMammal primers was tested in silico and by amplifying DNAs extracted from tissues. The results suggested that MiMammal primers are capable of amplifying and distinguishing a diverse group of mammalian species. In addition, analyses of water samples from zoo cages of mammals with known species composition suggested that MiMammal primers could successfully detect mammalian species from water samples in the field. Then, we performed an experiment to detect mammals from natural ecosystems by collecting five 500-ml water samples from ponds in two cool-temperate forests in Hokkaido, northern Japan. MiMammal amplicon libraries were constructed using eDNA extracted from water samples, and sequences generated by Illumina MiSeq were subjected to data processing and taxonomic assignment. We thereby detected multiple species of mammals common to the sampling areas, including deer (Cervus nippon), mouse (Mus musculus), vole (Myodes rufocanus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), rat (Rattus norvegicus) and shrew (Sorex unguiculatus). Many previous applications of the eDNA metabarcoding approach have been limited to aquatic/semiaquatic systems, but the results presented here show that the approach is also promising even for forest mammal biodiversity surveys.},

  abstract = {Effective ecosystem conservation and resource management require quantitative monitoring of biodiversity, including accurate descriptions of species composition and temporal variations of species abundance. Accordingly, quantitative monitoring of biodiversity has been performed for many ecosystems, but it is often time- and effort-consuming and costly. Recent studies have shown that environmental DNA (eDNA), which is released to the environment from macro-organisms living in a habitat, contains information about species identity and abundance. Thus, analysing eDNA would be a promising approach for more efficient biodiversity monitoring. In the present study, internal standard DNAs (i.e. known amounts of short DNA fragments from fish species that have never been observed in a sampling area) were added to eDNA samples, which were collected weekly from a coastal marine ecosystem in Maizuru Bay, Japan (from April 2015 to March 2016) and metabarcoding analysis was performed using Illumina MiSeq to simultaneously identify fish species and quantify fish eDNA copy numbers. A correction equation was obtained for each sample using the relationship between the number of sequence reads and the added amount of the standard DNAs and this equation was used to estimate the copy numbers from the sequence reads of non-standard fish eDNA. The calculated copy numbers showed significant positive correlations with those determined by quantitative PCR, suggesting that eDNA metabarcoding with standard DNA enabled useful quantification of eDNA. Furthermore, for samples that show a high level of PCR inhibition, this method might allow more accurate quantification than qPCR because the correction equations generated using internal standard DNAs would include the effect of PCR inhibition. A single run of Illumina MiSeq produced \&gt;70 quantitative fish eDNA time series in this study, showing that this method could contribute to more efficient and quantitative monitoring of biodiversity.},

However, significant money-, labor-, and time-costs are still required for performing eDNA metabarcoding. In this study, we assessed the performance of an “early-pooling” protocol (a protocol based on 1st PCR tagging) to reduce the experimental costs of library preparation for eDNA metabarcoding. Specifically, we performed three experiments to investigate the effects of 1st PCR-tagging and 2nd PCR-indexing protocols on the community composition revealed by eDNA metabarcoding, the effects of post-1st PCR exonuclease purification on tag jumping (corresponds to index hopping in 2nd PCR indexing), and the effects of the number of PCR replicates and the eDNA template volume on the number of detected OTUs. Analyses of 204 eDNA libraries from three natural aquatic ecosystems and one mock eDNA sample showed that (i) 1st PCR tagging does not cause clear biases in the outcomes of eDNA metabarcoding, (ii) post-1st PCR exonuclease purification reduces the risk of tag jumping, and (iii) increasing the eDNA template volume may increase the number of detected OTUs and reduce variations in the detected community compositions, similar to increasing the number of 1st PCR replicates. Our results show that an early-pooling protocol with post-1st PCR exonuclease purification and an increased amount of the DNA template reduces the risk of tag jumping, the costs for consumables and reagents (except for many tagged 1st PCR primers), and the handling time in library preparation, and produces similar results to a 2nd PCR-indexing protocol. Therefore, once a target metabarcoding region is selected and a set of tagged-1st PCR primers is prepared, the early-pooling protocol provides a cost, labor, and time-efficient approach for processing a large number of samples.},

  abstract = {MitoFish, MitoAnnotator, and MiFish Pipeline are comprehensive databases of fish mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes), accurate annotation software of fish mitogenomes, and a web platform for metabarcoding analysis of fish mitochondrial environmental DNA (eDNA), respectively. The MitoFish Suite currently receives over 48,000 visits worldwide every year; however, the performance and usefulness of the online platforms can still be improved. Here, we present essential updates on these platforms, including an enrichment of the reference data sets, an enhanced searching function, substantially faster genome annotation and eDNA analysis with the denoising of sequencing errors, and a multisample comparative analysis function. These updates have made our platform more intuitive, effective, and reliable. These updated platforms are freely available at http://mitofish.aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp/.},
